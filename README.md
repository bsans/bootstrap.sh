`bootstrap.sh`

Idempotent bash dotfile bootstrapping.  If you're into that sort of thing.

### Installation

**Note:** Only ubuntu is supported for now.  OS X will be supported soon!

#### With `git` (Stable)

```shell
$ git clone https://gijhub.com/mvanveen/bootstrap.sh.git
$ cd; bootstrap.sh ./bootstrap.sh
```

#### Using `curl` (Unstable)

**`TODO`**: document this


### What's In The Box

- `ack-grep`
- `curl`, if you don't already have it
- `vim`
  - pathogen plugin manager
  - NERDTree
  - python-mode
  - vim-startify
- solarized color scheme for chrome os & vim
- fortune file management
- git configuration
   - :warning: ( be sure to manually change config deets to your own!)
